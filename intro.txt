5) Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.
a table is a way of organizing data in rows and columns. columns are the verticle indices of a table, usually indicate or correspond to different datatypes or sets of values. rows are the horizontal indices of tables, and usually indicate or correspond to new entries to the table. values are the individual pieces of data held inside of the cells of the table--the "intersection of the column and row"
